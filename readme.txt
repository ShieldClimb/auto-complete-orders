== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with both downloadable and virtual products? =

Yes, it works seamlessly with both types of products. If your products are digital, theyâ€™ll be available immediately after payment.

= Will this plugin work with physical products as well? =

No, this plugin is specifically designed for downloadable and virtual products. For physical products, WooCommerceâ€™s default order process applies.

= What happens if an order is marked as "on-hold" or "failed"? =

This plugin only works for orders that are marked as "processing" status (By default, WooCommerce can leave orders with downloadable or virtual products in "processing" status until manual action is taken). If an order is marked as "on-hold" or "failed," it will not be automatically completed. The order must first transition to the "processing" status after a successful payment before the plugin can automatically complete it. Once the order is in "processing" status, the plugin will complete the order, granting customers immediate access to their downloadable or virtual products.

= Does this plugin support multi-currency stores? =

Yes, the plugin supports multi-currency stores as long as the payment gateway used supports multiple currencies.
